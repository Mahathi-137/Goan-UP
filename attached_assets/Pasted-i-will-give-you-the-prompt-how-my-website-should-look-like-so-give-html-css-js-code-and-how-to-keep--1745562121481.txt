i will give you the prompt how my website should look like so give html,css,js code and how to keep it in vs code my website should have the following things so give code accordingly 1. if we click it should ask like this user name , age , gender next after logged  in we should get option like select a village then country drop down which should contain 10 countries India pakka then after clicking india i should get state selection drop down 10 states then select Telangana then should get option select village and should get 5 villages and give names to villages click village 1 give any name to it display it's terrain like hilly area , desert area then when u click that village 1 it should have a 3d map take a Indian 3d map from sketchfab or anything which should look 3d realistic like village 3D map like this 1. Hut:
“Generate a low-poly Indian village hut with a thatched roof, mud walls, and small wooden door, optimized for web 3D scene (.glb format)”
2. Tree:
“Create a low-poly 3D model of a neem tree or mango tree suitable for rural Indian village scenes (.glb or .obj)”
3. Pond:
“Generate a 3D model of a small rural pond with muddy banks, grass, and water reflection, for a village scene in India”
4. Villager:
“Create a simple 3D character of an Indian villager wearing traditional clothes like dhoti or saree, low-poly, suitable for a web game (.glb)”
5. Cow/Bullock Cart:
“Generate a low-poly 3D model of an Indian cow or bullock cart typically found in rural villages, optimized for Three.js (.glb)”
6. Village Environment:
“Generate a 3D scene of an Indian village with huts, trees, pond, and farm field in a realistic low-poly style for web-based 3D apps (.glb)”
Where to Use These Models in Your Code:
Once the AI gives you .glb files:
You can use the GLTFLoader in Three.js to import them. 
I can show you how to load these models into your current code—just let me know once you get a .glb file.
Would you like me to show how to load a .glb hut into your scene with code?

You said:
Do that have 3d look 
ChatGPT said:
Yes — the models you generate with those prompts can absolutely have a 3D look, just like in realistic games or simulations. When loaded using Three.js, you’ll be able to:
Pan, zoom, and rotate around them 
See them from any angle 
View depth, shadows, and lighting 
Interact with them in a real-time 3D scene 
So yes, they’ll look fully 3D and immersive — especially when you:
Use proper lighting (like directional + ambient lights) 
Apply realistic textures (like mud, straw, wood) 
Load .glb files via GLTFLoader which supports 3D structure + materials 
Want Proof?
Here’s an example screenshot of what it might look like if you add a .glb hut model in Three.js:
Ground plane as land 
Realistic 3D hut model loaded 
Trees as .glb 
Camera orbit + zoom 
Real shadows + lighting 
It’s like a Google Maps 3D + game-style village.
Would you like me to:
Give you a sample .glb hut model to test? 
Show the full code for loading .glb models with GLTFLoader? 
Let me know and I’ll guide you step by step.

where we can zoom in and out and a heat map which contains population density, where trees are present where water bodies are present  then sectors for development we have six sectors Agriculture, health, rural roads, water supply and sanitation, education and health  games where players can see their villages problem and solve it in a gamified way . so we should get hyperlinks with those sectors it's like mini games and get a option like play now after we click for each sector we should get a game to play that game should depend on village 1 map which u give like which problems it have so that game should solve those in a fun way like  u should give map with no proper roads so it should give no proper roads it should give build roads and any suggestions for health build hospital each should have fixed budget initially give 10 lakh budget to player so u know na so give cost for everything see he can develop any one sector or all or some sectors so in that game u should include xp points u will earn is this much give more points for hospital like that everything 4.leaderboard including the top soltioness and marks for each sector Xp earned 📈 XP & Development Points

and total marks user name also in leaderboard then comes the main thing ai chat bot so user should be able to chat with it ask his doubts on how to play or on what basics he will get marks or any doubts about the things which exist in that selected village 1 so chat bot should have that data it should give smart suggestions to player like cost estimation vs budget validation life span and consequences predictions restricted areas detection Chatbot AI System

Example is this but follow my above steps combine this also and give accordingly 
✅ PHASE 1: Core System & Game Foundation
🔹 1. User Onboarding & Login
Examples:
1. Sign up via phone number and OTP
2. Create avatar & username
3. Save progress locally and in cloud
4. Onboarding walkthrough: "Welcome to Rural Builder!"
5. Link account to Google/Apple ID
🔹 2. Village Selection & Models
Examples:
1. Select: India > Maharashtra > Demo Village A
2. View: Hilly village, plains, coastal, desert
Dummy villages with unique challenges: drought-
prone, remote, overpopulated
3.
4. Visual terrain: red soil, rocky land, flooded zone
Custom name village on selection (e.g.,
“You chose
Satvadi Village!”)
5.
🔹 3. Village Overview Interface
Examples:
1. 3D satellite-style view of village
2. Toggle between day/night or seasonal views
3. Zoom in on buildings, roads, farms
View current infrastructure: tap on school to see “50
students, no toilet”
4.
5. Highlight terrain types: slope, water body, forest patch

So ai chat bot should have full knowledge on this things for village 1 so like how we ask chatgpt or deep seek for any question and it will answer na so our chatbot should also answer the questions immediately about that village so make it like that 
Design a visually appealing, responsive website with a traditional Indian village theme called “Goan Up”.

The website should have:

A beautiful village-style background (mud roads, huts, trees, nature) as the hero section.

A traditional logo or icon representing an Indian village (e.g., a hut with trees and sun).

The website title “Goan Up” in a rustic, earthy font with warm colors (brown, orange, green).

Use a color palette with earthy tones (mud brown, leaf green, sky blue, terracotta red).

Add gentle animations on scroll (fade-in, slide) and highlight village visuals (huts, farms, trees).

Mobile-friendly and clean navigation with scroll or sticky menu.

Include a feedback form at the bottom with fields: Name, Email, and Feedback box.
  6.helpline numbers and social media of the website make a website including all the components 



Give entire code and tell in step by step where to keep that code in vs code and if u give files that 3d map one which code to keep in which file and how to link everything and make a final website

give all codes files , folders where to keep what to keep everrthing in vs code when i open with live server it should come entire website pls give
